What is SimBEV?
---------------

SimBEV stands for "Simulation of Battery Electric Vehicles". SimBEV uses german mobility data to calculate expected
charging demand of electric vehicles in different regions and scenarios. The key features of SimBEV are:

* Detailed modelling of driving profiles
* Stepwise simulation without using perfect foresight
* Calculating charging demand in a region split into 4 use cases
